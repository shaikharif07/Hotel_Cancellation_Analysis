# Hotel_Cancellation_Analysis

# Overview:
This repository contains the code and findings for the Hotel Cancellation Analysis project. The project aims to analyze hotel booking cancellations for both City Hotel and Resort Hotel, identify key factors affecting cancellations, and propose data-driven strategies to reduce cancellation rates.

# Business Problem: 
In recent years, both City Hotel and Resort Hotel have been grappling with high cancellation rates, leading to various issues such as decreased revenue and underutilized hotel rooms. Addressing the challenge of reducing cancellation rates is a top priority for both hotels to enhance revenue generation and improve overall operational efficiency. This report aims to analyze hotel booking cancellations while excluding irrelevant factors and focusing on revenue generation.

# Assumptions:
No significant unforeseen events occurred between 2015 and 2017 that would significantly impact the analyzed data.
The data used in this analysis is still current and relevant for making effective business decisions.
The hotels are not currently utilizing any of the suggested strategies.
Booking cancellations have the most substantial impact on revenue generation.
Cancellations result in vacant rooms for the entire duration of the originally booked stay.
Research Questions
What are the variables that affect hotel reservation cancellations?
How can we make hotel reservations cancellations better?
How will hotels be assisted in making pricing and promotional decisions?

# Hypothesis:
More cancellations occur when prices are higher.
When there is a longer waiting list, customers tend to cancel more frequently.
Analysis & Findings
The analysis reveals several important insights:

Approximately 37% of clients have cancelled their reservations, significantly impacting the hotel's earnings.
City hotels tend to receive more bookings compared to resort hotels, possibly due to lower prices in city locations.
Daily rates at city hotels are generally lower than at resort hotels, with potential price increases during weekends and holidays.
August has the highest number of confirmed reservations, while January experiences the highest number of cancellations.
Cancellations are more prevalent when prices are higher, suggesting accommodation cost is a significant factor.
Portugal has the highest count of cancellations among all countries analyzed.
Around 46% of clients make reservations through online travel agencies, while 27% come from group bookings. Only 4% book directly in person, and Transient customers have the highest cancellation rate at 82%.

# Suggestions:
Based on the analysis, the following strategies are recommended:

Pricing Strategies: Consider revising pricing strategies to reduce reservation cancellations. Lowering rates for specific hotels based on locations or offering discounts and promotions can incentivize customers to retain reservations and discourage cancellations.
Weekend and Holiday Discounts: Offer reasonable discounts on room prices during weekends or holidays to attract more bookings and reduce cancellations, especially in the resort hotel segment.
January Campaigns: Launch targeted campaigns or marketing initiatives during January to encourage guests to retain reservations and increase revenue during the high cancellation period.
Focus on Quality and Services: Improve hotel quality and enhance services, particularly in Portugal where cancellation rates are high, to reduce cancellations and increase guest satisfaction.
Online Travel Agent Management: Ensure online representations accurately align with hotel offerings to minimize cancellations facilitated by online travel agents and enhance customer satisfaction.
